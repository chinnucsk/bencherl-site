Stavros Aronis, Nikolaos Papaspyrou, Katerina Roukounaki, Konstantinos Sagonas, Yiannis Tsiouris, and Ioannis E. Venetis, 
<b>A Scalability Benchmark Suite for Erlang/OTP</b>, 
Eleventh ACM SIGPLAN Erlang Workshop (Copenhagen, Denmark, September 2012).

<div class="abstract">
<p>Programming language implementers rely heavily on benchmarking for measuring
and understanding performance of algorithms, architectural designs, and 
trade-offs between alternative implementations of compilers, runtime systems, 
and virtual machine components. Given this fact, it seems a bit ironic that it 
is often more difficult to come up with a good benchmark suite than a good 
implementation of a programming language.</p>
<p>This paper presents the main aspects of the design and the current status of 
bencherl, a publicly available scalability benchmark suite for applications 
written in Erlang. In contrast to other benchmark suites, which are usually 
designed to report a particular performance point, our benchmark suite aims to 
assess *scalability*, i.e., help developers to study a set of performance points
that show how an application's performance changes when additional resources 
(e.g., CPU cores, schedulers, etc.) are added. We describe the scalability 
dimensions that the suite aims to examine and present its infrastructure and 
current set of benchmarks. We also report some limited set of performance 
results in order to show the capabilities of our suite.</p>
