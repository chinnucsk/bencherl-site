##### Abstract

Programming language implementers rely heavily on benchmarking for measuring and
understanding performance of algorithms, architectural designs, and trade-offs
between alternative implementations of compilers, runtime systems, and virtual
machine components. Given this fact, it seems a bit ironic that it is often more
difficult to come up with a good benchmark suite than a good implementation of a
programming language.

This paper presents the main aspects of the design and the current status of a
(soon-to-be) publicly available scalability benchmark suite for applications
written in Erlang, using the Erlang/OTP system in particular. In contrast to
other benchmark suites, which are usually designed to report a particular
performance point, our benchmark suite aims to assess *scalability*, i.e., to
study how an application's performance changes when additional resources
(e.g. CPU cores, schedulers, etc.) are added, using series of performance
points. We describe the scalability dimensions that the suite aims to measure
and present its infrastructure and current set of benchmarks. We also report
some limited set of performance results in order to show the capabilities of our
suite.
