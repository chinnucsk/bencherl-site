BenchErl is a publicly available scalability benchmark suite for applications written in Erlang, using the Erlang/OTP system in particular. In contrast to other benchmark suites, which are usually designed to report a particular performance point, our benchmark suite aims to assess scalability, i.e., a set of performance points that show how an applicationâ€™s performance changes when additional resources (e.g. CPU cores, schedulers, etc.) are added.
